# 1. An Introduction to Ajax Programming
**Ajax** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is used to transfer data asynchronously between a web browser and a web server.

#### XML (Extensible Markup Language).
**XML** is a markup language in which data is hierarchically structured as text data. **XML** is used for exchanging data between different computer systems and especially over the Internet. The **X** in **Ajax** stands for **XML** but in practice, *JSON* is used more and more.


It is a way to refresh individual parts of a web page without reloading the entire web page. This means with Ajax it is possible to create faster dynamic web pages. This reduces the amount of data transfer.

Asynchronous with Ajax means that script execution continues when an HTTP request is made, because this request to the web server is executed in the background, and the user can continue to use the page. Without Ajax, this process is synchronous, which means that script execution stops until the requested data comes back from the web server.
